Angular Demo Application. 

This project was used to explore Angular 8, Azure, and .NET core (2.2).

The output is a web app that displays "resume" page with a list of ranked skills, and a "current weather" 
page that shows current weather conditions.

Currently was most recently published at https://raoulcore220191027105238.azurewebsites.net

The "resume" page demonstrates Angular UI controls using responsive design. The page will scale to a 
laptop or mobile browser in landscape or portrait mode. 

The weather page explores a remote API connection, location services, as well as some simple SVG graphics.
